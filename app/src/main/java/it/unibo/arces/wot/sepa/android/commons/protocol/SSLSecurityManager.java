/**
 * The Class SSLSecurityManager.
 * 
 * * ### Key and Certificate Storage ###
 * 
 * The Java platform provides for long-term persistent storage of cryptographic
 * keys and certificates via key and certificate stores. Specifically, the
 * java.security.KeyStore class represents a key store, a secure repository of
 * cryptographic keys and/or trusted certificates (to be used, for example,
 * during certification path validation), and the java.security.cert.CertStore
 * class represents a certificate store, a public and potentially vast
 * repository of unrelated and typically untrusted certificates. A CertStore may
 * also store CRLs.
 * 
 * KeyStore and CertStore implementations are distinguished by types. The Java
 * platform includes the standard PKCS11 and PKCS12 key store types (whose
 * implementations are compliant with the corresponding PKCS specifications from
 * RSA Security). It also contains a proprietary file-based key store type
 * called JKS (which stands for "Java Key Store"), and a type called DKS
 * ("Domain Key Store") which is a collection of keystores that are presented as
 * a single logical keystore.
 * 
 * ### PKI Tools ###
 * 
 * There are two built-in tools for working with keys, certificates, and key
 * stores:
 * 
 * keytool is used to create and manage key stores. It can
 * 
 * - Create public/private key pairs
 * 
 * - Display, import, and export X.509 v1, v2, and v3 certificates stored as
 * files
 * 
 * - Create self-signed certificates
 * 
 * ### Secure Communication ###
 * 
 * The data that travels across a network can be accessed by someone who is not
 * the intended recipient. When the data includes private information, such as
 * passwords and credit card numbers, steps must be taken to make the data
 * unintelligible to unauthorized parties. It is also important to ensure that
 * you are sending the data to the appropriate party, and that the data has not
 * been modified, either intentionally or unintentionally, during transport.
 * 
 * Cryptography forms the basis required for secure communication, and that is
 * described in Section 4. The Java platform also provides API support and
 * provider implementations for a number of standard secure communication
 * protocols.
 * 
 * ### SSL/TLS ###
 * 
 * The Java platform provides APIs and an implementation of the SSL and TLS
 * protocols that includes functionality for data encryption, message integrity,
 * server authentication, and optional client authentication. Applications can
 * use SSL/TLS to provide for the secure passage of data between two peers over
 * any application protocol, such as HTTP on top of TCP/IP.
 * 
 * The javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket class represents a network socket that
 * encapsulates SSL/TLS support on top of a normal stream socket
 * (java.net.Socket). Some applications might want to use alternate data
 * transport abstractions (e.g., New-I/O); the javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine class is
 * available to produce and consume SSL/TLS packets.
 * 
 * The Java platform also includes APIs that support the notion of pluggable
 * (provider-based) key managers and trust managers. A key manager is
 * encapsulated by the javax.net.ssl.KeyManager class, and manages the keys used
 * to perform authentication. A trust manager is encapsulated by the
 * TrustManager class (in the same package), and makes decisions about who to
 * trust based on certificates in the key store it manages.
 * 
 * The Java platform includes a built-in provider that implements the SSL/TLS
 * protocols:
 * 
 * SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2
